- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on project Library Service(check the last changes https://github.com/vr242kj/Library/pull/2, continue working for merging branches in main). Console application (at first) which will definitely grow into something more :smiley: :rocket:
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java Core -> JDBC -> JPA/ Hibernate -> Spring IoC, MVC -> Spring Boot, Spring Data, Spring Security.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with learning java and its frameworks to become a back-end developer. More precisely, a more experienced developer who will give hints and do code reviews :pray:
